3D Modeler: A project I wrote as part of my college curriculum.
-----------
This is a 3D modeling tool that lets users create models from primitive shapes and apply transformations (translation, rotation, scaling). It also features raytracing and texturing capabilities, all powered by the DirectX9 API.


How to use
-------------

The software can be Controlled both by Keyboard and Mouse.
The key description is as follows.

Mode selection
--------------
F1 ğŸ¡ª Wireframe mode.
F2 ğŸ¡ª Solid fill mode.


Create/Delete Objects
---------------------
Numbers 1-9 are for creating Object in the 3D Space. Every object is created in the centre and its pivot is also initilised in the center.

1 ğŸ¡ª Sphere
2 ğŸ¡ª Chamfer
3 ğŸ¡ª Cone
4 ğŸ¡ª Hedra
5 ğŸ¡ª Teapot
6 ğŸ¡ª Torous
7 ğŸ¡ª Torous_knot
8 ğŸ¡ª Male figure (complex model)
9 ğŸ¡ª Cube

Del ğŸ¡ª Destroys the selected object.
ESC ğŸ¡ª destroys all Objects.

Apply Texture
-------------
F3, F4 ğŸ¡ª  used to apply textures to the Object.


Movement controls
-----------------
Right Direction ğŸ¡ª Rotates in positive x-axis.
Ctrl + Right Direction ğŸ¡ª Translates in positive x-axis
Left Direction ğŸ¡ª Rotates in negative x-axis
Ctrl + Left Direction ğŸ¡ª Translates in negative x-axis

Up Direction ğŸ¡ª Rotates in positive y-axis.
Ctrl + Up Direction ğŸ¡ª Translates in positive y-axis.
Down Direction ğŸ¡ª Rotates in negative y-axis
Ctrl + Down Direction ğŸ¡ª Translates in negative y-axis

Home ğŸ¡ª Rotates in positive z-axis.
Ctrl + Home ğŸ¡ª Translates in positive z-axis.
End ğŸ¡ª Rotates in negative z-axis
Ctrl + End ğŸ¡ª Translates in negative z-axis


S ğŸ¡ª Scale an object in positive magnitude.
Shift + S ğŸ¡ª Scale an object in negative magnitude.

TAB ğŸ¡ª makes the objects/camera into focus for control.
G ğŸ¡ª enables/disables the GRID.
P ğŸ¡ª enables/disables pivot point selection of an Object.
Space-Bar ğŸ¡ª selects the next object in line.

Mouse Controls:
The mouse can be used to translate, rotate or scale an object by simple drag n drop.
The Mouse is also capable to control the camera also panning and focus change are the two main controls over camera.

However to do this we require the keyboard to set controls.

F5 ğŸ¡ª Selects translation mode for objects.
F6 ğŸ¡ª Selects Rotation mode for objects.
F7 ğŸ¡ª Selects scaling mode for objects.

F ğŸ¡ª enables/disables Focus point translation for cameras.

Left Click ğŸ¡ª for objects.
Right Click ğŸ¡ª Camera control.
